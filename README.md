# readme-file-generator

## Description

This application is a readme file generator using node.js


I wanted a faster way to create a usefull and informational readme file that covers all of the important details that a readme would have.

This makes it faster for the developer to create a readme so they can spend that extra time elsewhere.
- What did you learn?
I learned how to use node.js to create a program that will interact with the user using prompts to generate a readme file.


## Installation

you will need to have node installed for this program
